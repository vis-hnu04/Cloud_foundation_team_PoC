# Notification configuration
{: .no_toc}

TEAM supports email notifications via Amazon SES, Slack notifications via a custom Slack app, and custom notificatons via Amazon SNS. Notifications can be configured from the **Settings page**.

## Notification Types
### Email notification via Amazon SES
TEAM supports email notifications via Amazon SES either in the TEAM deployment account, or in another AWS account if authorized.
- To use Amazon SES in the **TEAM deployment account**, enable it, and for production use cases, move SES out of **sandbox mode** - [Moving out of the Amazon SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html)
- Designate a verified email address in Amazon SES for originating approval and TEAM workflow notifications - [Verifying identities in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html)
  > If your SES account is in sandbox mode, and for testing, make sure all requester, approver and notification email addresses are verified in SES otherwise TEAM notification would not function as expected.
  {: .note}
- As a TEAM administrator, navigate to the Settings page. Click on **Edit** to Enable email notifications and enter the source email address. If using an SES identity in another account, set the SES Source ARN, otherwise leave it blank.

### Slack notifications
- As a TEAM administrator, navigate to the Settings page. 
- Click on the **Edit** button to enable Slack notification.
- **Install the Slack app** to your Slack workspace by clicking the provided link. 
- In the Slack app page, click on the **OAuth & Permissions** section and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**. 
- In the TEAM Settings page, enable Slack notifications and enter the **Bot User OAuth Token** as the **Slack OAuth token**.

> The Slack app creates a Bot user with several permission _scopes_. Review these before installation. The permissions include viewing email addresses of Slack users, viewing user profile details, starting direct messages with people, and sending messages as the bot user. **Protect the generated OAuth token** as it retains these permissions and should be considered a secret.

### Custom notifications via Amazon SNS
TEAM creates an SNS topic in the **TEAM deployment account** named **TeamNotifications-main**. You may create subscriptions to this topic that will receive the full event details when notifications are generated.
- As a TEAM administrator, navigate to the Settings page. 
- Click on **Edit** to enable SNS notifications.
- In the **TEAM deployment account**, create an SNS subscription to the TEAM notification topic named **TeamNotifications-main**.
- Configure your subscription target as desired to handle messages delivered via Amazon SNS. SNS will deliver a subject and a JSON-encoded message to the target.
